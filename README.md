# Week9-Codepath
Week 9 Turn-in

I used Dionaea

Some issues I encountered were setting up the VM on my mac. Getting setup with the google cloud was explained weirdly but I got it. I also had trouble getting the json data exported. I'm not sure if it was my software version or because I was using visual studio code to view the json file. 

The number 1 attack was on port 8088 which is tcp/udp. port 23 seems to be the second most attacked port which makes sense since port 23 is one of the oldest protocols.  I had this running for about three hours and it was almost 190 attacks. 

I think it's pretty cool that software like this exists.
